# Getting started with EOSC

## Registration & Access to EOSC 

To access most EOSC services, we recommend using EGI Check-in so we first need to register to EGI Check-in and then enroll to a VO (Virtual Organisation) of an EOSC service.

### Registration to EGI Check-in with EGI SSO

- Go to https://sso-admin.egi.eu/admin/email

### Enrollment to a VO to access an EOSC service

The step above are done once and allow to register and access EOSC services. To access a specific EOSC service, you have to *enroll" to a *Virtual Organization*. A specific service can have several Virtual Organizations to customize access (for instance, provide different quotas, etc.).

Some EOSC services enroll users "automatically" when they sign-up to their service. For others, you need to request access.
