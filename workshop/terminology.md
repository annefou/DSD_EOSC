## Glossary

- **EOSC**: European Open Science Cloud

- **EOSC portal**: The [EOSC Portal](https://eosc-portal.eu/) is part of the EOSC implementation roadmap as one of the expected “federating core” services contributing to the implementation of the “Access and interface” action line. It has been conceived to provide a European delivery channel connecting the demand-side and the supply-side of the EOSC and all its stakeholders.

- **Marketplace**: The [Marketplace](https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu) is the EOSC Portal tool where researchers can discover, order and access the services, analytical tools, data management tools, storage and computing services they need for their work.

- **EOSC service**: It can be either an online service (e.g. a web portal or a web service) or it can be a 'human' service, such as training and consultancy. A service brings value to users and facilitates them to implement Open Science.

- **VO**: In the context of EOSC, **VO** stands for Virtual Organisation. A Virtual Organisation (VO) is a group of users. VOs are created to group researchers who aim to share resources and access services to achieve a common goal as part of a scientific collaboration. VOs can also be organised in a hierarchical structure for creating groups or subgroups within a VO.

- **Enrolling to a VO**: For most EOSC services, users need to register to the given service before being able to use it. This is done by **enrolling to a VO** that is associated to a given service. 


- **EGI Check-in**: [EGI Check-in](https://www.egi.eu/service/check-in/) is a proxy service that operates as a central hub to connect federated Identity Providers (IdPs) with EGI service providers.
