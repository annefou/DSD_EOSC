# Examples of services to realize Open Science in practice
To practice Open Science, we need to share data, code, tools, and results (see image below), early and definitely not at the end of a project. The goal of this section is to introduce some of the EOSC services that can help you to do that. 

## EOSC | Explore https://search.marketplace.eosc-portal.eu 

Browse through over 3 millions of research and innovation tools and services, thousands of datasets from a wide scale of research domains from renowned European service providers.

## OpenAIRE | Explore https://explore.openaire.eu 


A comprehensive and open dataset of research information covering 174M publications, 60M research data, 397K research software items, from 129K data sources, linked to 3M grants and 204K organizations. All linked together through citations and semantics.

## ROHub, Research Data Management Hub https://www.rohub.org 

Research Objects are used to gather the data, code, tools and results so when publishing a paper, the RO DOI can be provided and would contain all the required information.
 
## EGI Datahub https://datahub.egi.eu 


DataHub allows you to bring data close to computing to exploit it efficiently, and to publish a dataset and make it available to a specific community, or worldwide, across federated sites.



## Jupyter notebook services:

### EGI notebooks https://notebooks.egi.eu/hub 

Notebooks is a browser-based tool for interactive analysis of data using EGI storage and compute services.

- General purpose:
- Number of CPU Cores    1 - 8
- Amount of RAM per CPU core    1 - 4 GB
- Local disk    10 - 40 GB
- Access type    opportunistic - reserved 


### EGI Replay https://replay.notebooks.egi.eu 


EGI Replay allows to reproduce and share custom computing environments effortlessly. With Replay one can replicate the execution of their analysis in a notebooks-based platform ensuring that others can easily access and interact with the content. The service builds on BinderHub, and allows to build docker images from a Git repository and then makes them available through your browser with EGI resources (up to 6GB RAM, no hard limit on the session time per user, etc.).

## European Galaxy Server https://usegalaxy.eu 



The European Galaxy server is an open web-based platform for data intensive research which provides access to computing and storage resources without charge, but also tools, training material and a Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIAaS). Taking it further EuroScienceGateway (http://www.eurosciencegateway.eu) is a project which aims at connecting Galaxy to large e-infrastructures in order to be able to distribute jobs across Europe (Pulsar Network).


## Pangeo@EOSC

And you can also “become” a service provider. For instance, EOSC-Pangeo http://pangeo-eosc.vm.fedcloud.eu  


The latest version of the Pangeo stack and, depending on your selection:
- A Jupyter notebook with Pangeo Python core packages (Xarray, Iris, Dask)
- A Machine Learning notebook (with Tensorflow and a GPU)
- A similar Pytorch notebook (also with GPU)
- A DataScience notebook (with also Julia and R)
